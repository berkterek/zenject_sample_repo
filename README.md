# Zenject Sample Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to the `zenject_sample_repo`! This educational repository demonstrates the use of the Zenject Dependency Injection (DI) framework within Unity projects. Zenject offers a robust alternative to the traditional singleton pattern, providing more flexible and testable code structures, which is crucial for maintaining large-scale Unity applications.

## Features

- **Zenject Setup**: Learn how to integrate Zenject into Unity.
- **IoC vs. Singleton**: Examples and benefits of using Inversion of Control (IoC) with Zenject over standard singleton patterns.
- **Flexible and Testable**: Guidance on structuring your Unity projects to make them more manageable and easily testable.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following before starting:
- Unity (Version 20XX.X or later)
- Git
